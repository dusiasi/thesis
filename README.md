# Tape FM

Tape FM is a collaborative music mixtape streaming web application. Users join channels where they can share music mixes, invite friends to their channels, upload mixes, add comments, and stay updated on the latest activities. They can also listen the mixes from different channels, making it a modern twist on the classic mixtapes from the 90s.
